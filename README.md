# NeurIPS-Ariel-2025

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the NeurIPS - Ariel Data Challenge 2025, a competition focused on deriving exoplanet signals from simulated data of the Ariel mission, 
a European Space Agency project to study exoplanet atmospheres. The project includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of metadata, signal, and calibration files, with plans 
to develop machine learning models that extract the chemical spectra of the exoplanet atmospheres by the deadline of September 24, 2025.

## Current Progress
- **EDA**
  - Completed initial EDA
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct in-depth EDA
  - Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Model development
